========

pykids is a voluntary effort to bring Python to K-12 kids. 
 - Our blog is publicly available at http://hello.pykids.us/. 
 - Students can sign up and start using the jupyter notebooks (Python3) hosted at our server. They can save their notebooks to resuse later. 
 - They can sign up for local classes/meetups for instructor based learning via the blog.
